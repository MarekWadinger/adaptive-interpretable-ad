  abstract   = {Anomaly detection is an important problem that has been researched within diverse research areas and application domains. Many anomaly detection techniques have been specifically developed for certain application domains, while others are more generic. This survey tries to provide a structured and comprehensive overview of the research on anomaly detection. We have grouped existing techniques into different categories based on the underlying approach adopted by each technique. For each category we have identified key assumptions, which are used by the techniques to differentiate between normal and anomalous behavior. When applying a given technique to a particular domain, these assumptions can be used as guidelines to assess the effectiveness of the technique in that domain. For each category, we provide a basic anomaly detection technique, and then show how the different existing techniques in that category are variants of the basic technique. This template provides an easier and more succinct understanding of the techniques belonging to each category. Further, for each category, we identify the advantages and disadvantages of the techniques in that category. We also provide a discussion on the computational complexity of the techniques since it is an important issue in real application domains. We hope that this survey will provide a better understanding of the different directions in which research has been done on this topic, and how techniques developed in one area can be applied in domains for which they were not intended to begin with.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an unsupervised, density-based approach to anomaly detection. The purpose is to define a smooth yet effective measure of outlierness that can be used to detect anomalies in nonlinear systems. The approach assigns each sample a local outlier score indicating how much one sample deviates from others in its locality. Specifically, the local outlier score is defined as a relative measure of local density between a sample and a set of its neighboring samples. To achieve smoothness in the measure, we adopt the Gaussian kernel function. Further, to enhance its discriminating power, we use adaptive kernel width: in high-density regions, we apply wide kernel widths to smooth out the discrepancy between normal samples; in low-density regions, we use narrow kernel widths to intensify the abnormality of potentially anomalous samples. The approach is extended to an online mode with the purpose of detecting anomalies in stationary data streams. To validate the proposed approach, we compare it with several alternatives using synthetic datasets; the approach is found superior in terms of smoothness, effectiveness and robustness. A further experiment on a real-world dataset demonstrated the applicability of the proposed approach in fault detection tasks.}

  abstract  = {This paper introduces a generic and scalable framework for automated anomaly detection on large scale time-series data. Early detection of anomalies plays a key role in maintaining consistency of person's data and protects corporations against malicious attackers. Current state of the art anomaly detection approaches suffer from scalability, use-case restrictions, difficulty of use and a large number of false positives. Our system at Yahoo, EGADS, uses a collection of anomaly detection and forecasting models with an anomaly filtering layer for accurate and scalable anomaly detection on time-series. We compare our approach against other anomaly detection systems on real and synthetic data with varying time-series characteristics. We found that our framework allows for 50-60 {\%} improvement in precision and recall for a variety of use-cases. Both the data and the framework are being open-sourced. The open-sourcing of the data, in particular, represents the first of its kind effort to establish the standard benchmark for anomaly detection.},

  abstract = {In the past decade, rapid technological advances in the fields of electronics and telecommunications have given rise to versatile, ubiquitous decentralized embedded sensor systems with ad hoc wireless networking capabilities. Typically these systems are used to gather large amounts of data, while the detection of anomalies (such as system failures, intrusion, or unanticipated behavior of the environment) in the data (or other types or processing) is performed in centralized computer systems. In spite of the great interest that it attracts, the systematic porting and analysis of centralized anomaly detection algorithms to a decentralized paradigm (compatible with the aforementioned sensor systems) has not been thoroughly addressed in the literature. We approach this task from a new angle, assessing the viability of localized (in-node) anomaly detection based on machine learning. The main challenges we address are: (1) deploying decentralized, automated, online learning, anomaly detection algorithms within the stringent constraints of typical embedded systems; and (2) evaluating the performance of such algorithms and comparing them with that of centralized ones. To this end, we first analyze (and port) single and multi-dimensional input classifiers that are trained incrementally online and whose computational requirements are compatible with the limitations of embedded platforms. Next, we combine multiple classifiers in a single online ensemble. Then, using both synthetic and real-world datasets from different application domains, we extensively evaluate the anomaly detection performance of our algorithms and ensemble, in terms of precision and recall, and compare it to that of well-known offline, centralized machine learning algorithms. Our results show that the ensemble performs better than each individual decentralized classifier and that it can match the performance of the offline alternatives, thus showing that our approach is a viable solution to detect anomalies, even in environments with little a priori knowledge.}

  abstract = {We are seeing an enormous increase in the availability of streaming, time-series data. Largely driven by the rise of connected real-time data sources, this data presents technical challenges and opportunities. One fundamental capability for streaming analytics is to model each stream in an unsupervised fashion and detect unusual, anomalous behaviors in real-time. Early anomaly detection is valuable, yet it can be difficult to execute reliably in practice. Application constraints require systems to process data in real-time, not batches. Streaming data inherently exhibits concept drift, favoring algorithms that learn continuously. Furthermore, the massive number of independent streams in practice requires that anomaly detectors be fully automated. In this paper we propose a novel anomaly detection algorithm that meets these constraints. The technique is based on an online sequence memory algorithm called Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM). We also present results using the Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (NAB), a benchmark containing real-world data streams with labeled anomalies. The benchmark, the first of its kind, provides a controlled open-source environment for testing anomaly detection algorithms on streaming data. We present results and analysis for a wide range of algorithms on this benchmark, and discuss future challenges for the emerging field of streaming analytics.}

  abstract = {Regression model-based electrical load anomaly detection shows great potential to improve the quality of demand side management (DSM) because the load prediction and detection requirements can be satisfied by a single framework simultaneously. However, compared with other detection methods, both prediction and detection accuracy need improvement. To overcome this limitation, this work proposes a residential electrical load anomaly detection framework (RELAD) that includes a hybrid one-step-ahead load predictor (OSA-LP) and a rule-engine-based load anomaly detector (RE-AD). Considering that the diversity and randomness of residential electricity usage may render prediction difficult, the OSA-LP cascades an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model and artificial neural networks (ANN) to achieve high precision in linear and nonlinear regression. Meanwhile, through employing the Bayesian information criterion (BIC), the OSA-LP efficiently reduces the influence of the over- or underfitting problem in real-time prediction and improves the prediction accuracy. To remedy the deficiency of overreliance on prediction outcomes in regression-model-based anomaly detection methods, the RE-AD integrates a support vector machine (SVM), the k-nearest neighbors (kNN) method and the cross-entropy loss function to develop an independent detection process to analyze the correctness of data. This method was applied to detect the load of the off-grid solar power plant in Ngurudoto, a rural area in Tanzania with 44 households and nearly 150 residents. The results of the practical application demonstrate that the proposed predictor and anomaly detector exhibit better predictive and detective accuracy than that achieved in previous work, which demonstrates the practicality of the proposed method.}

  abstract = {To solve energy and environment crisis, large amounts of renewable energy power generation has been integrated to modern power grids, resulting in power quality decline, frequency fluctuation, and stability deterioration. In this case, advanced control and regulation means for power systems are needed. Static synchronous compensator (STATCOM) is a shunt-connected flexible AC transmission system device that is often used for reactive power control. When associated with battery energy storage systems (BESSs), the adjustment capabilities of STATCOM can be extended to four quadrants. Therefore, the hybrid BESS/STATCOM can influence modern power system operation. A system-level electromechanical transient mathematical model for BESS/STATCOM is established, based on the circuit structure of battery, three-phase bridge converter and a low-pass filter. Then, a typical real and reactive power coordinated control strategy based on the double-loop scheme is developed for BESS/STATCOM. Finally, the influence of BESS/STATCOM on the system's transient stability is tested, according to simulations conducted on IEEE 3-machine 9-bus standard system. Simulation results show that BESS/STATCOM can improve the transient stability under charging state, but abnormality has been found that BESS/STATCOM might not alleviate the angle stability and voltage drop as much as those in the discharging state.},
