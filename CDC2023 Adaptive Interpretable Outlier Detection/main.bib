abstract = {Anomaly detection is an important problem that has been researched within diverse research areas and application domains. Many anomaly detection techniques have been specifically developed for certain application domains, while others are more generic. This survey tries to provide a structured and comprehensive overview of the research on anomaly detection. We have grouped existing techniques into different categories based on the underlying approach adopted by each technique. For each category we have identified key assumptions, which are used by the techniques to differentiate between normal and anomalous behavior. When applying a given technique to a particular domain, these assumptions can be used as guidelines to assess the effectiveness of the technique in that domain. For each category, we provide a basic anomaly detection technique, and then show how the different existing techniques in that category are variants of the basic technique. This template provides an easier and more succinct understanding of the techniques belonging to each category. Further, for each category, we identify the advantages and disadvantages of the techniques in that category. We also provide a discussion on the computational complexity of the techniques since it is an important issue in real application domains. We hope that this survey will provide a better understanding of the different directions in which research has been done on this topic, and how techniques developed in one area can be applied in domains for which they were not intended to begin with.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a generic and scalable framework for automated anomaly detection on large scale time-series data. Early detection of anomalies plays a key role in maintaining consistency of person's data and protects corporations against malicious attackers. Current state of the art anomaly detection approaches suffer from scalability, use-case restrictions, difficulty of use and a large number of false positives. Our system at Yahoo, EGADS, uses a collection of anomaly detection and forecasting models with an anomaly filtering layer for accurate and scalable anomaly detection on time-series. We compare our approach against other anomaly detection systems on real and synthetic data with varying time-series characteristics. We found that our framework allows for 50-60{\%} improvement in precision and recall for a variety of use-cases. Both the data and the framework are being open-sourced. The open-sourcing of the data, in particular, represents the first of its kind effort to establish the standard benchmark for anomaly detection.},

abstract = {The enrichment in building operation data has enabled the development of advanced data-driven methods for building energy predictions. Existing studies mainly focused on the utilization of supervised learning techniques for model development, while overlooking the significance of feature engineering. Feature engineering are helpful for reducing data dimensionality, decreasing prediction model complexity, and tackling the problem of corrupted and noisy information. Considering that each building has unique operating characteristics, it is neither practical nor efficient to manually identify features for model developments. Data-driven feature engineering methods are thus needed to ensure the flexibility and generalization of building energy prediction models. Using operation data of real buildings, this paper investigates the performance of different deep learning techniques in automatically deriving high-quality features for building energy predictions. Three types of deep learning-based features are developed using fully-connected autoencoders, convolutional autoencoders and generative adversarial networks respectively. Their potentials in building energy predictions have been exploited and compared with conventional feature engineering methods. The study validates the usefulness of deep learning in enhancing building energy prediction performance. The research results help to automate and improve the predictive modeling process while bridging the knowledge gaps between deep learning and building professionals.}

  abstract={Modern manufacturers are currently undertaking the integration of novel digital technologies - such as 5G-based wireless networks, the Internet of Things (IoT), and cloud computing - to elevate their production process to a brand new level, the level of smart factories. In the setting of a modern smart factory, time-critical applications are increasingly important to facilitate efficient and safe production. However, these applications suffer from delays in data transmission and processing due to the high density of wireless sensors and the large volumes of data that they generate. As the advent of next-generation networks has made network nodes intelligent and capable of handling multiple network functions, the increased computational power of the nodes makes it possible to offload some of the computational overhead. In this paper, we show for the first time our IA-Net-Lite industrial anomaly detection system with the novel capability of in-network data processing. IA-Net-Lite utilizes intelligent network devices to combine data transmission and processing, as well as to progressively filter redundant data in order to optimize service latency. By testing in a practical network emulator, we showed that the proposed approach can reduce the service latency by up to 40{\%}. Moreover, the benefits of our approach could potentially be exploited in other large-volume and artificial intelligence applications.},

abstract = {In the past decade, rapid technological advances in the fields of electronics and telecommunications have given rise to versatile, ubiquitous decentralized embedded sensor systems with ad hoc wireless networking capabilities. Typically these systems are used to gather large amounts of data, while the detection of anomalies (such as system failures, intrusion, or unanticipated behavior of the environment) in the data (or other types or processing) is performed in centralized computer systems. In spite of the great interest that it attracts, the systematic porting and analysis of centralized anomaly detection algorithms to a decentralized paradigm (compatible with the aforementioned sensor systems) has not been thoroughly addressed in the literature. We approach this task from a new angle, assessing the viability of localized (in-node) anomaly detection based on machine learning. The main challenges we address are: (1) deploying decentralized, automated, online learning, anomaly detection algorithms within the stringent constraints of typical embedded systems; and (2) evaluating the performance of such algorithms and comparing them with that of centralized ones. To this end, we first analyze (and port) single and multi-dimensional input classifiers that are trained incrementally online and whose computational requirements are compatible with the limitations of embedded platforms. Next, we combine multiple classifiers in a single online ensemble. Then, using both synthetic and real-world datasets from different application domains, we extensively evaluate the anomaly detection performance of our algorithms and ensemble, in terms of precision and recall, and compare it to that of well-known offline, centralized machine learning algorithms. Our results show that the ensemble performs better than each individual decentralized classifier and that it can match the performance of the offline alternatives, thus showing that our approach is a viable solution to detect anomalies, even in environments with little a priori knowledge.}

  abstract={In the past recent years, Machine Learning methodologies have been applied in countless application areas. In particular, they play a key role in enabling Industry 4.0. However, one of the main obstacles to the diffusion of Machine Learning-based applications is related to the lack of interpretability of most of these methods. In this work, we propose an approach for defining a `feature importance' in Anomaly Detection problems. Anomaly Detection is an important Machine Learning task that has an enormous applicability in industrial scenarios. Indeed, it is extremely relevant for the purpose of quality monitoring. Moreover, it is often the first step towards the design of a Machine Learning-based smart monitoring solution because Anomaly Detection can be implemented without the need of labelled data. The proposed feature importance evaluation approach is designed for Isolation Forest, one of the most commonly used algorithm for Anomaly Detection. The efficacy of the proposed method is tested on synthetic and real industrial datasets.},

  abstract={This paper looks into the problem of detecting network anomalies by analyzing NetFlow records. While many previous works have used statistical models and machine learning techniques in a supervised way, such solutions have the limitations that they require large amount of labeled data for training and are unlikely to detect zero-day attacks. Existing anomaly detection solutions also do not provide an easy way to explain or identify attacks in the anomalous traffic. To address these limitations, we develop and present GEE, a framework for detecting and explaining anomalies in network traffic. GEE comprises of two components: (i)Variational Autoencoder (VAE)- an unsupervised deep-learning technique for detecting anomalies, and (ii)a gradient-based fingerprinting technique for explaining anomalies. Evaluation of GEE on the recent UGR dataset demonstrates that our approach is effective in detecting different anomalies as well as identifying fingerprints that are good representations of these various attacks.},

  abstract={Anomaly detection in industrial processes is crucial for general process monitoring and process health assessment. Deep Neural Networks {\(DNNs)\} based anomaly detection has received increased attention in recent work. Albeit their high accuracy, the black-box nature of DNNs is a drawback in practical deployment. Especially in industrial anomaly detection systems, explanations of DNN detected anomalies are crucial. This paper presents a framework for DNN based anomaly detection which provides explanations of detected anomalies. The framework answers the following questions during online processing: 1\{)\} “why is it an anomaly?” and 2\{)\} “what is the confidence?” Further, the framework can be used offline to evaluate the “knowledge” of the trained DNN. The framework reduces the opaqueness of the DNN based anomaly detector and thus improves human operators' trust in the algorithm. This paper implements the first steps of the presented framework on the benchmark KDD-NSL dataset for Denial of Service (DoS) attack detection. Offline DNN explanations showed that the DNN was detecting DoS attacks based on features indicating destination of connection, frequency and amount of data transferred while showing an accuracy around 97{\%}.},

abstract = {Process monitoring is a critical activity in manufacturing industries. A wide variety of data-driven approaches have been developed and employed for fault detection and fault diagnosis. Analyzing the existing process monitoring schemes, prediction accuracy of the process status is usually the primary focus while the explanation (diagnosis) of a detected fault is relegated to a secondary role. In this paper, an interpretable unsupervised machine learning model based on Bayesian Networks (BN) is proposed to be the fundamental model supporting the process monitoring scheme. The proposed methodology is aligned with the recent efforts of eXplanatory Artificial Intelligence (XAI) for knowledge induction and decision making, now brought to the scope of advanced process monitoring. A BN is capable of combining data-driven induction with existing domain knowledge about the process and to display the underlying causal interactions of a process system in an easily interpretable graphical form. The proposed fault detection scheme consists of two levels of monitoring. In the first level, a global index is computed and monitored to detect any deviation from normal operation conditions. In the second level, two local indices are proposed to examine the fine structure of the fault, once it is signaled at the first level. These local indices support the diagnosis of the fault, and are based on the individual unconditional and conditional distributions of the monitored variables. A new labeling procedure is also proposed to narrow down the search and identify the fault type. Unlike many existing diagnosis methods that require access to faulty data (supervised diagnosis methods), the proposed diagnosis methodology belongs to the class that only requires data under normal conditions (unsupervised diagnosis methods). The effectiveness of the proposed monitoring scheme is demonstrated and validated through simulated datasets and an industrial dataset from semiconductor manufacturing.}

abstract = {We are seeing an enormous increase in the availability of streaming, time-series data. Largely driven by the rise of connected real-time data sources, this data presents technical challenges and opportunities. One fundamental capability for streaming analytics is to model each stream in an unsupervised fashion and detect unusual, anomalous behaviors in real-time. Early anomaly detection is valuable, yet it can be difficult to execute reliably in practice. Application constraints require systems to process data in real-time, not batches. Streaming data inherently exhibits concept drift, favoring algorithms that learn continuously. Furthermore, the massive number of independent streams in practice requires that anomaly detectors be fully automated. In this paper we propose a novel anomaly detection algorithm that meets these constraints. The technique is based on an online sequence memory algorithm called Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM). We also present results using the Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (NAB), a benchmark containing real-world data streams with labeled anomalies. The benchmark, the first of its kind, provides a controlled open-source environment for testing anomaly detection algorithms on streaming data. We present results and analysis for a wide range of algorithms on this benchmark, and discuss future challenges for the emerging field of streaming analytics.}
