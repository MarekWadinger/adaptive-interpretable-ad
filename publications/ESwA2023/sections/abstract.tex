In this paper, we introduce an Adaptable and Interpretable Framework for Anomaly Detection (AID) designed for streaming energy systems utilizing IoT devices. AID leverages adaptive conditional probability distribution modeling to capture the normal operation of dynamic systems and isolate root causes of anomalies. The framework dynamically updates parameter of multivariate Gaussian distribution, allowing it to adapt to non-stationarity. AID interprets anomalies as significant deviations from conditional probabiity, encompassing interactions as well as both spatial and temporal irregularities by exposing them as features. Additionally, dynamic process limits are drawn to pinpoint root causes. The framework also alerts individual signal as outliers in sampling. Two real-world case studies showcase AID's capabilities. The first study focuses on Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS), demonstrating AID's effectiveness in capturing system anomalies, providing less conservative signal limits, and leveraging a physical model for temperature anomaly detection. The second case study delves into monitoring temperature profiles of battery modules, where AID successfully identifies hardware faults, emphasizing its importance in energy storage system safety and profitability. A benchmark evaluation on industrial data shows that AID delivers comparable results to other self-learning adaptable anomaly detection methods, with the added advantage of root cause isolation. % AID represents a significant step forward in adaptable and interpretable anomaly detection for streaming energy systems, offering valuable insights and diagnostic capabilities for improving system reliability and performance.
