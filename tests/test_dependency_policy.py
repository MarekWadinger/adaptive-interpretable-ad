"""Enforce the dependency version-constraint policy.

The policy keeps Dependabot churn intentional and CVE patches unimpeded:

* **Never upper-capped** -- security/safety libraries (a fix shipped in a
  new major must install without a manifest edit) and stable, loosely
  coupled cores, typing shims, stubs and plugins.
* **Capped to ``<next-major``** -- libraries whose APIs this project calls
  directly and which break across major releases.

Every runtime dependency must appear in exactly one set below; an
unclassified one fails :func:`test_every_runtime_dependency_is_classified`,
forcing a deliberate decision whenever a dependency is added. The dev,
build and example groups are development-time only and out of scope.
